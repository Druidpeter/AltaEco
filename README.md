# AltaEco

AltaEco is Global Ecosystem Simulator that is designed with the Conworlder and Game Dev in mind.

## Introduction

I'll probably update this readme in lockstep with actually implementing features of the application. For now, here's a general synopsis and roadma.

AltaEco is intended to be a command-line utility that helps preprocess various assets to aid in the production of large-numbers-n-scale video game assets, such as open world terrain generation at unprecedented levels of detail. It is also designed to help those from the "Constructed Language & World" community to generate maps of exceedingly high fidelity and detail, and also to take into account realistic global system effects like weather patterns, ecological systems, migration patterns, etc.

That's it for now, folks. More stuff to come! :^D
